Do You Love Me? - Interactive Webpage

This is a fun, interactive webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents users with a playful “Do you love me?” question, and offers two buttons, Yes and No. The twist? The “No” button playfully avoids being clicked! Once the user clicks “Yes,” a sweet message is displayed along with animated hearts floating across the screen.
